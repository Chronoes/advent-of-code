To generate new day, run `mix help gen_day` to get information on how to operate it.

Results of input can be seen using custom script

```bash
# First stage of current day
$ mix run priv/solve_day.exs f
# Second stage of day 10
$ mix run priv/solve_day.exs s 10
# All stages of day 17 year 2017
$ mix run priv/solve_day.exs a 17 2017
```

Tests with `mix test` contain correct solutions to sample inputs and real inputs.
